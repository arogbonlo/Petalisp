;;; The recipe of a kernel is used both as a blueprint of some
;;; performance-critical function and as a key to search whether such a
;;; function has already been generated and compiled. The latter case is
;;; expected to be far more frequent, so the primary purpose of a recipe is
;;; to select an existing function as fast as possible and without consing.
;;;
;;; To achieve this, each recipe is built from uconses. Furthermore, the
;;; recipe grammar has been chosen to maximize structural sharing and to
;;; avoid unnecessary uconses.
