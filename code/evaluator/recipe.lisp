;;; The recipe of a kernel is used both as a blueprint of some
;;; performance-critical function and as a key to search whether such a
;;; function has already been generated and compiled. The latter case is
;;; expected to be far more frequent, so the primary purpose of a recipe is
;;; to select an existing function as fast as possible and without
;;; consing. To achieve this, the recipe is stored as a tree of hash
;;; conses.
