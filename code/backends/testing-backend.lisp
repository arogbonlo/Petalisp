;;; For testing purposes, it is useful to compute the same recipes using

;;; The testing backend is constructed from a sequence of other
;;; backends. Each COMPUTE-IMMEDIATES instruction is then dispatched among
;;; these and the results are compared. If there is a mismatch, an error is
;;; signaled.
