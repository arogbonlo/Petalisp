;;; The goal is to translate a data flow graph into a graph of executable
;;; parts, called kernels. The data flow nodes form a directed acyclic
;;; graph. The graph is fully determined by a set of graph roots, typically
;;; the nodes passed to SCHEDULE.
;;;
;;; The result is a graph consisting only of immediate values, where each
;;; immediate is the target of one or more kernels. Each kernel describes
;;; how values of a subspace of the index space of its target can be
;;; computed. Furthermore each kernel tracks the set of its sources,
;;; i.e. those immediates that are referenced during their
;;; evaluation. Since the resulting immediate graph is used to decide a
;;; scheduling and allocation strategy, it is important that its kernels
;;; are easy to analyze, yet expressive enough to denote fast programs.
;;;
;;; The high level steps of the kernelization algorithm are as follows:
;;;
;;; 1. Determine the set of critical nodes, i.e. nodes that are referenced
;;;    more than once, are graph roots, are the input of a broadcasting
;;;    reference or have multiple inputs containing reductions. Each
;;;    critical node will later be the target of one or more kernels.
;;;
;;; 2. By construction, the nodes starting from one critical node, up to
;;;    and including the next critical nodes, form a tree. All fusion nodes
;;;    therein can be eliminated by determining a set of index spaces whose
;;;    union is the index space of the current critical node, but where
;;;    paths from each index space never pass through more than one input
;;;    of each fusion node.
;;;
;;; 3. For each index space from the previous step, create a suitable
;;;    kernel. To do so, the problem must be translated to a blueprint and
;;;    its iteration space must be determined.
;;;
;;; Once every critical node and index space thereof has been processed,
;;; the algorithm terminates.

;;; 1. Critical Nodes
;;;
;;; Critical nodes are the nodes that will later be allocated in main
;;; memory. All other nodes will only appear implicit as the part of a
;;; blueprint. The naive approach --- to treat each node as a critical node
;;; --- would lead to an insane number of allocations and memory
;;; traffic. Instead, the goal is to find a minimal set of critical nodes,
;;; while preserving some crucial properties.
;;;
;;; The criteria to determine critical nodes are:
;;;
;;; - An immediate is a critical node. This implies that all leaves of the
;;;   data flow graph are critical nodes. However such a critical node is
;;;   cheap, because it has already been allocated.
;;;
;;; - Each graph root is a critical node -- the whole purpose of Petalisp
;;;   is to compute the values of these graph roots.
;;;
;;; - A node that appears as an input of multiple other nodes of the same
;;;   graph, is a critical node. As a result, all non-critical nodes have
;;;   only a single user and --- as a consequence --- appear inside a tree,
;;;   whose root and leaves are critical nodes.
;;;
;;;   This tree property is a crucial prerequisite for blueprint creation,
;;;   scheduling and code generation.
;;;
;;; - The input of a broadcasting reference is a critical node. This
;;;   criterion is hardly obvious, but prevents a particular edge-case. If
;;;   broadcasting nodes would be allowed inside kernels, one could
;;;   construct a sequence of alternating reductions and broadcasts and
;;;   produce arbitrarily large kernels. On the other hand, the input of a
;;;   broadcasting reference is usually orders of magnitude smaller than
;;;   the output, so allocating it explicitly is hardly severe.
;;;
;;; - A node is a critical node, if it has more than one input path
;;;   containing a reduction node. This rather arcane criterion achieves,
;;;   that the iteration space of each kernel is an n-dimensional strided
;;;   cube, simplifying later analysis considerably. Introducing these
;;;   critical nodes is not terribly expensive, since the target of some
;;;   reductions is usually orders of magnitude smaller than their inputs.
