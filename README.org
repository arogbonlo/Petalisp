#+TITLE: Petalisp

Petalisp is an attempt to generate high performance code for parallel
computers from a pure data flow specification.


** Keeping it small and simple
Petalisp aims to be small and simple. It is an universal truth that (given similar indentation) one thousand lines of code are easier to read and maintain than one million lines of code. But please do NOT obtain this brevity by using short names and few comments and line breaks. Write short code by using abstraction and generic methods.

If you are curious, the following snippet tells you the current size of Petalisp in non-whitespace source lines of code:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -path './.git' -prune -o -print | egrep '\.asd|\.lisp' | xargs cat | sed '/^\s*$/d' | wc -l
#+END_SRC
