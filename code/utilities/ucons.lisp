;;; ucons - unique conses
;;;
;;; Some applications benefit a lot by reusing existing cons cells instead
;;; of actual consing. Usually this technique is called hash consing.
;;; Users of this technique are e.g. the optimizer of the computer algebra
;;; system Maxima and the theorem prover ACL2.
;;;
;;; This particular implementation is intended for use cases where
;;; performance is so critical, that even a single hash table access is too
;;; expensive. To achieve such near-optimal speed, this implementation does
;;; not actually provide conses, but uconses. A ucons has not only a car
;;; and a cdr, but also a table of past users. Furthermore, the cdr of each
;;; ucons is restricted and may only contain other uconses or NIL. As a
;;; consequence, all lists of uconses are proper lists and data structures
;;; of uconses are always trees. This setup has several advantages:
;;;
;;; - the check whether a certain ucons already exists is a single lookup
;;;   of its car in the table of its cdr
;;;
;;; - the immutability of the car and cdr of a ucons is enforced by the
;;;   defstruct definition of ucar
;;;
;;; - a compiler has reliable type information of the slots of a ucons
;;;
;;; Unfortunately there is also a painful downside of this
;;; approach. Traditional cons cells are a fundamental Lisp data type and
;;; well supported throughout the standard library. Uconses lack this
;;; integration, e.g. it is not possible to treat them as a sequence. As a
;;; result, many utility functions have to be reimplemented specifically
;;; for uconses.
;;;
;;; Finally, it must be noted that uconses are --- except if one eventually
;;; clears the *UCONS-ROOT-TABLE* --- a permanent memory leak. But if you
;;; are willing to accept these trade-offs, uconses offer some unique
;;; benefits:
;;;
;;; - their usage is little more expensive than a call to CONS. If you
;;;   include GC time, they can even be much faster.
;;;
;;; - given enough potential for structural sharing, uconses can decrease
;;;   the memory consumption of an application by orders of
;;;   magnitude. Often, this results in vastly improved cache utilization.
;;;
;;; - checks for structural similarity can be done in constant time. Two
;;;   ucons-expressions are equal if and only if their head uconses are EQ.
