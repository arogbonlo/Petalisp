;;; A buffer represents a set of memory locations big enough to hold one
;;; element of type ELEMENT-TYPE for each index of the buffer's shape.
;;; Each buffer is written to by zero or more kernels and read from zero or
;;; more kernels.

   (%inputs :initarg :inputs :accessor inputs :initform nil)
   ;; The list of kernels that load from this buffer.
   (%outputs :initarg :outputs :accessor outputs :initform nil)))

;;; A kernel represents a computation that, for each element in its
;;; iteration space, reads from some buffers and writes to some buffers.
;;; Its exact behavior is determined by its instructions, which are
;;; accessible via the slots LOADS and STORES.

;;; The behavior of a kernel is described by its iteration space and its
;;; instructions.  The instructions form a DAG, whose leaves are loads or
;;; references to iteration variables, and whose roots are store
;;; instructions.
;;;
;;; The instruction number of an instruction is an integer that is unique
;;; among all instructions of the current kernel.  Instruction numbers are
;;; handed out in depth first order of instruction dependencies, such that
;;; the roots (store instructions) have the highest numbers and that the
;;; leaf nodes (load and iref instructions) have the lowest numbers.

;;; A call instruction represents the application of a function to a set of
;;; values that are the result of other instructions.  Each argument is

;;; car is an integer describing which of the multiple values of the cdr is
;;; to be used.

;;; specified by the current element of the iteration space and the load's
;;; transformation.

;;; A store instruction represents a write to main memory.  It stores the
;;; given value (represented as a cons cell, just like the arguments of a
;;; call instruction) at the entry of the buffer storage specified by the
;;; current element of the iteration space and the store instruction's
;;; transformation.  A store instruction returns zero values.

;;; An iref instruction represents an access to elements of the iteration

;;; taking the element denoted by AXIS of the index that is the result of
;;; transforming the current element of the iteration space with the iref's
;;; transformation.
(defclass iref-instruction (iterating-instruction)
  ((%axis :initarg :axis :reader axis)))

;;; A reduce instruction represents a binary tree reduction along the axis
;;; zero of the iteration space.  Each argument is represented as a cons
;;; cell, whose cdr is another instruction, and whose car is an integer
;;; describing which of the multiple values of the cdr is to be used.  The
;;; operator of the reduce instruction is a function that takes twice as
;;; many arguments as the instruction itself, and returns as many values as
;;; the instruction has arguments.
