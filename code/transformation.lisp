;;;
;;; transformations on structured operands
;;;
;;; the concept of transformations deserves special explanation. All
;;; transformations in Petalisp are deriveable from the following five
;;; elementary transformations:
;;;
;;; (1) shifting the indices by a constant
;;; (2) multiplying the indices by a constant
;;; (3) permuting the indices
;;; (4) introducing indices with only one element
;;; (5) removing indices with only one element
;;;
;;; The class TRANSFORMATION contains all objects that are formed by
;;; functional composition of the five elementary operations. A beautiful
;;; property is that each of these transformations is an isomorphism. In
;;; particular this means they can be inverted with INVERT.
