;;; For testing purposes, it is useful to compute the same recipes using
;;; different virtual machines and compare the result.
;;;
;;; The testing virtual machine is constructed from a sequence of other
;;; virtual machines. Each VM/SCHEDULE instruction is then dispatched among
;;; these and the results are compared. If there is a mismatch, an error is
;;; signaled.
