;;; ucons - unique conses
;;;
;;; Some applications benefit a lot by reusing existing cons cells instead
;;; of actual consing.  Usually this technique is called hash consing.
;;; Users of this technique are e.g. the optimizer of the computer algebra
;;; system Maxima and the theorem prover ACL2.
;;;
;;; This particular implementation is intended for use cases where
;;; performance is so critical, that even a single hash table access per
;;; cons is too expensive.  To achieve such near-optimal speed, this
;;; library does not actually provide conses, but uconses.  A ucons has not
;;; only a car and a cdr, but also a table of past users.  Furthermore, the
;;; cdr of each ucons is restricted to other uconses or NIL.  This setup
;;; has several advantages:
;;;
;;; - Checking whether a certain ucons already exists is a single lookup of
;;;   its car in the table of its cdr.
;;;
;;; - The immutability of a ucons is enforced by its defstruct definition
;;;
;;; - The compiler has reliable type information of the slots of a ucons.
;;;
;;; - Lists of uconses are neither circular, nor improper.
;;;
;;; Unfortunately there is also a painful downside of this approach.
;;; Traditional cons cells are a fundamental Lisp data type and well
;;; supported throughout the standard library.  Uconses lack this
;;; integration and require a completely new set of library functions.
;;; Furthermore it must be noted that uconses are --- except if one
;;; explicitly clears the *UCONS-LEAF-TABLE* --- a permanent memory leak.
;;;
;;; Yet if you are willing to accept these trade-offs, uconses offer some
;;; unique benefits:
;;;
;;; - their usage is little more expensive than a call to CONS. If you
;;;   include GC time, they can even be much faster.
;;;
;;; - given enough potential for structural sharing, uconses can decrease
;;;   the memory consumption of an application by orders of magnitude.
;;;
;;; - checks for structural similarity can be done in constant time.  Two
;;;   ucons trees are equal if and only if their roots are EQ.
;;;
;;; Benchmarks:
;;; (SBCL 1.3.20, X86-64 Intel i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40GHz)
;;;
;;; (bench  (list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)) -> 25.77 nanoseconds
;;; (bench (ulist 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)) -> 38.18 nanoseconds
