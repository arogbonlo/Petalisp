;;; Kernelization is the process of breaking a data flow specification into
;;; a set of executable parts. The data flow specification is given by a
;;; set of graph roots (usually the arguments passed to SCHEDULE) and forms
;;; a DAG (directed acyclic graph).
;;;
;;; The following algorithm cuts such a DAG into as large as possible
;;; kernels. All nodes of a kernel, up to the beginning of the next kernels
;;; form a tree, i.e. they have exactly one successor. Later, this allows
;;; to build a corresponding s-expression to actually evaluate each kernel.
;;;
;;; The result of kernelization is a set of kernels. The original DAG is
;;; not mutated in the process.
;;;
;;; The first step in the algorithm is the creation of a *USE-TABLE*, a
;;; hash table mapping each graph node to its successors. It would seem
;;; more efficient to track the users of each node at DAG construction time
;;; and avoid this indirection, but we are only interested in those users
;;; that are reachable via the given graph roots. This way the system
;;; implicitly eliminates dead code.
;;;
;;; Once the *USE-TABLE* is populated, the graph is traversed a second
;;; time, to generate a kernelized copy of it. A node with more than one
;;; user triggers the creation of a new kernel. The hash table
;;; *KERNEL-TABLE* memoizes repeated calls to KERNELIZE-NODE.
;;;
;;; Each kernel is represented by one kernel target and several kernel
;;; fragments. The target is eventually bound to some memory, before any of
;;; the fragments are run.
