;;; We differentiate between two kinds of errors -- those triggered by
;;; improper usage of Petalisp and those occurring even though Petalisp has
;;; been used correctly. The former are expected to be far more frequent
;;; and part of the everyday user experience, while the latter should
;;; ideally never arise. Consequentially, errors triggered by the user
;;; should emit a detailed and helpful report, while the latter do not even
;;; deserve their own condition type.

(define-condition petalisp-user-error (simple-error) ())

;;; A wrapper around ASSERT, that signals a condition of type
;;; PETALISP-USER-ERROR.
