;;; The purpose of IR conversion is to turn a data flow graph, whose nodes
;;; are strided arrays, into an analogous graph, whose nodes are buffers
;;; and kernels.  Kernels and buffers alternate, such that the inputs and
;;; outputs of a kernel are always buffers, and such that the inputs and
;;; outputs of a buffer are always kernels.
;;;
;;; The IR conversion algorithm proceeds along the following steps:
;;;
;;; 1. A hash table is created that maps certain strided arrays to buffers
;;;    of the same size and element type.  This table is constructed such
;;;    that any subgraph without these nodes is a tree and contains no
;;;    reduction nodes.
;;;
;;; 2. Each root of a subtree from step 1 is turned into one or more
;;;    kernels.  All fusion nodes in the tree are eliminated by choosing
;;;    the iteration space of the kernels appropriately.
;;;
;;; 3. All buffers are updated to contain a list of kernels that read to
;;;    them or write from them.
