(document-function ir-from-lazy-arrays
  "Returns a list of buffers that form the root of an IR data flow graph
that is equivalent to the data flow graph specified by the supplied
LAZY-ARRAYS.

An IR graph is consists of alternating buffers and kernels.  Each kernel
reads and writes from zero or more buffers and writes to zero and more
buffers.  The behavior or each kernel is described by a directed acyclic
graph of instructions.
")

(document-function normalize-ir
  "Modify the IR data flow graph specified by the supplied ROOT-BUFFERS
such that it has fewer degrees of freedom.  This is achieved by
transforming all buffers to a zero-based coordinate system with minimal
stride, and by arranging each buffer such that the kernels using it have
optimal spatial locality.

In any case, the IR normalization preserves semantics.")
