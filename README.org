#+TITLE: Petalisp

Petalisp is an attempt to generate high performance code for parallel
computers from a pure data flow specification.

Petalisp aims to be simple, also when it comes to lines of code. If you are curious, the following snippet counts the number of non-whitespace source lines of code:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
find . -path './.git' -prune -o -print | egrep '\.asd|\.lisp' | xargs cat | sed '/^\s*$/d' | wc -l
#+END_SRC
