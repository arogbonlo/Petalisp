;;; The blueprint of a kernel is used to construct some
;;; performance-critical function and as a key to search whether such a
;;; function has already been generated and compiled. The latter case is
;;; expected to be far more frequent, so the primary purpose of a blueprint
;;; is to select an existing function as fast as possible and without
;;; consing.
;;;
;;; To achieve this, each blueprint is built from uconses. Furthermore, the
;;; blueprint grammar has been chosen to maximize structural sharing and to
;;; avoid unnecessary uconses.
